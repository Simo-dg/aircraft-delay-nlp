# Aircraft Delay Log Intelligence

This project uses NLP to classify and explain aircraft delay reports using transformer models.

## Structure
- `data/`: Contains synthetic dataset and label map
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA, training, evaluation
- `model/`: Trained models (optional)
- `streamlit_app/`: Web app for interactive predictions

## Tasks
1. Text classification of delay cause
2. Optional: Named Entity Recognition (NER)
3. Optional: Streamlit demo for user interface

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get started.
